## ðŸš§ THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE ðŸš§
This program is still in early development. Expect lots of bugs, do not use for actual projects.

## JLCRS
This is a command line utility that streamlines and automates the process of importing JLCPCB components directly into a KiCAD project. All you need is the LCSC code of a component (e.g. `C2913206`), and this program takes care of converting the symbol and footprint from EasyEDA's proprietary format to KiCAD's file format, downloading the corresponding 3D model (if found) and attaching it to the footprint, and integrating the component into a library within the project.
